# Backend Mastery Journey 🚀  

Welcome to **Backend Mastery Journey**, a repository documenting my path to mastering backend development. This journey is focused on learning and implementing the foundational and advanced concepts required to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable backend systems.  

## 🌟 Goals  
1. Master backend development concepts, including distributed systems, databases, and API design.  
2. Build practical, real-world-inspired projects to solidify knowledge.  
3. Share my progress and projects with the developer community.

## 📚 Learning Focus Areas  
- **System Design**: Reliability, scalability, and maintainability.  
- **Data Modeling**: Relational and NoSQL databases, query languages, and schema design.  
- **Distributed Systems**: Replication, partitioning, and fault tolerance.  
- **Transactions**: ACID, isolation levels, and concurrency control.  
- **Data Processing**: Batch and stream processing techniques.
